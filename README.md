# ``BbAppHTML``

HTML rendering and display components.

## Overview

The BbAppHTML library provides components for rendering HTML content within SwiftUI views. It includes ``BbAppHTMLToPlainText(_:)`` for HTML string processing and sanitization, ``BbAppHTMLView`` for displaying HTML with native SwiftUI integration, and ``BbAppHTMLWebView`` for rendering complex HTML content using WebKit. These components enable rich text content display while maintaining security and performance.
